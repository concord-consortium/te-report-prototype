However, research indicates that students rarely develop a systems-level, mechanistic understanding of plate tectonics.\\n\\nIt is the goal of this module to help students develop complex and dynamic understandings of plate interactions in an investigatory context. To do this, we have developed two technology tools: one for data visualization, the **Seismic Explorer** (SE), introduced on the prior page, and one interactive plate tectonics simulation model, the **Tectonic Explorer** (TE).\\n\\nTE is a dynamic computer model for exploring plate interactions and their relationship to landforms such as volcanoes, mountains, and ocean trenches. \\n\\nTE allows students to observe sequences of events from which new landforms emerge. A cross-section tool enables students to see the dynamic changes happening at and below the surface simultaneously.\\n\\nThroughout the module, students use data gathered from explorations of SE and from investigations of geographic profiles to develop hypotheses about the nature of the dynamics of the plate system on Earth. Then, they test their hypotheses using TE to model the necessary conditions needed to account for the observed phenomena.\",\r\n    \"content2\": \"\",\r\n    \"mediaType\": \"none\",\r\n    \"mediaCaption\": \"Last, First. \\\"Title of Work.\\\" Year created.

You can think of this like what happens when part of a blanket is hanging off a bed and it is slowly pulled onto the floor by its own weight. \\n\\n\\nThe second place that gravity plays a role is at mid-ocean ridges, where the crust is thinner and hotter. As the magma rises up from the mantle, it pushes up on the overlying plates, pushing them apart and creating a mountain. Gravity then causes the plates to slide down the high ridge that is formed, which continues to push the plates outward. This is called the **ridge push** force. \\n\\nRecent research has shown that plates with more of their edges being subducted are faster-moving plates, leading researchers to think that slab pull may be the major driving force.
